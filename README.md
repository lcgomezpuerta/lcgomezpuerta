## 📑 Featured Data Projects

| Project | Description | Tech Stack | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ride-Sharing Efficiency (Zuber)** | Investigating the impact of weather on trip frequency and duration in Chicago using SQL, Web Scraping, and Hypothesis Testing. | SQL, Python, Beautiful Soup, Scipy | [View Project](https://github.com/lcgomezpuerta/zuber-chicago-analysis) |
| **Video Game Market Analysis (ICE)** | Strategic study of global sales and critic scores to identify high-potential segments for marketing campaigns. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Stats | [View Project](https://github.com/lcgomezpuerta/video-game-analysis) |

🔍 Project I Highlight: Video Game Market Analysis (ICE)
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and "TBD" entries in user scores to ensure statistical integrity.
- Market Intelligence: Identified the life cycle of gaming platforms and pinpointed leaders for the 2017 forecast.
- Statistical Testing: Performed T-tests to validate hypotheses regarding user ratings across different platforms and genres (Xbox One vs. PC).
- Regional Profiling: Analyzed consumer behavior differences between NA, EU, and JP markets.

🔍 Project II Highlight: Ride-Sharing Efficiency (Zuber)
- Data Retrieval: Performed Web Scraping to collect weather records and integrated them with a relational database.
- Complex SQL Queries: Utilized JOIN, GROUP BY, and CASE statements to categorize weather conditions and analyze competitor performance (Flash Cab vs. Others).
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed thousands of trips to identify the top 10 drop-off neighborhoods in Chicago.
- Advanced Hypothesis Testing: Tested the impact of external factors (rainy Saturdays) on trip duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport using T-tests.

## 🎯 Professional Interests
I am particularly interested in **Data Storytelling** and **People Analytics**, where I can combine my background in Communication and Education with data-driven decision-making.
